  Information and hints to enhance your tropical living experience
</h2>

<h3>House Manager</h3>
<p>
  Rebecca Wells is our villa manager in Manuel Antonio, and her husband Jacob is
  a skilled contractor and a computer electronics consultant. They live only a
  few minutes down our road. She and Jacob are completely bilingual, will help
  you with any problems, and will assist you with arrival arrangements.
</p>

<h3>Maid and Gardener</h3>
<p>
  Our maid comes mornings twice a week for four or five hours. If you would like
  additional help, Rebecca can arrange for that at the maid's regularly hourly
  rate, and she can be hired as well to do your personal laundry in the
  washer/drier. There is also a wash and fold laundromat service nearby at Hotel
  Flor Blanca. Our gardener comes once a week, early in the morning, for grounds
  maintenance. We hope you will treat our staff with trust and respect - they
  have ours.
</p>

<h3>Linens and Towels</h3>
<p>
  We supply all essential household goods, including linens and towels, but
  please do not take our towels to the beach.
</p>

<h3>Communications</h3>
<p>
  We have a smart TV with Netflix etc. available for use. Our house telephone
  line, 2777-1092, does not permit international calls. High-speed Internet
  service will provide those who bring devices with reliable WiFi. Since we
  often work from here internet access (fiber optic) is faster than you'll
  typically find elsewhere and can be upgraded up to 500mbps (for an additional
  charge) if required. The WiFi password is in the booklet near the phone.
</p>
<p>
  Cell towers are nearby and coverage is excellent for those who choose roaming.
</p>

<h3>Waste Disposal</h3>
<p>
  Please follow basic ecologically sound practices. There's a white composting
  container in the kitchen which the gardener will sort and empty from time to
  time. If you wish to empty it yourself the compost bin is behind the garden
  shed near the entrance. The maid will dispose of garbage, but if you need to
  do so yourself, you may place bagged garbage into a neighbourhood bin just
  down the road which is emptied regularly by the municipal service.
</p>

<h3>Garden</h3>
<p class="clearfix">
  Enjoy any fruit that ripens in the orchard. Bananas, papayas, pineapples,
  grapefruit, lemons, limes, sour and sweet oranges, mangos, coconuts, avocados
  and guayabana grow in front of and below the house. Many of these are
  seasonal, however, and our gardener will offer fruit as it comes available. It
  can be difficult for northerners to dsicent ripeness and availablity so please
  don't hesitate to ask him to pick for you. He's usually here on Fridays.
</p>

<h3>Water</h3>
<p>
  We are connected to the municipal system, and the water, as in most of Costa
  Rica is potable. Please rinse off beach sand in the outside shower before
  using those inside; otherwise the bathroom drains clog. We are on a septic
  system, so please do not flush non-biodegradables (dental floss, tampons,
  condoms etc.) which clog the septic tank.
</p>

<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>
  The climate tends to make electronic equipment and kitchen appliances more
  fragile than up north, so take more care with them than you usually would.
  During the green season, keep anything sensitive and electronic such as
  computer equipment in the dehumidified built-in wall unit in the living room
  with the TV. The sliding doors should be kept shut and locked when the devices
  are not in use.
</p>
<p>
  A temporal - two or three successive days of rain and drizzle - occurs rarely,
  and only in the green season. Leather goods can get a coating of fungus and
  are not recommended for this climate. Keep clothing free-hung so it has proper
  air circulation. In this part of the world, people never leave wet clothing in
  a heap - that encourages mildew. If it pours, just remember that the sun will
  soon shine. It is only with strong winds that you need lower any of the rain
  blinds or shut the wooden blinds.
</p>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>
  We are on the same voltage system as North America, and will run your hair
  dryer and all powered devices. The refrigerator should not be kept open, as
  that risks motor burnout. There are iPhone and Android chargers in the main
  room closet in case you forget.
</p>

<h3>Keys</h3>
<p>
  Rebecca will give you all necessary keys, and explain their use and the
  security rules. No one else but she and you will have access to the
  dehumidified storage unit.
</p>

<h3>Money</h3>
<p>
  U.S. dollars can be changed at any of several banks in Quepos and Manuel
  Antonio. The closest is a 15-minute walk toward the beach. There are ATMs
  there and in Quepos that take bank cards. All businesses and restaurants
  accept U.S. dollars, and almost all accept major credit cards.
</p>

<h3>Restaurants</h3>
<p>
  There are many simple-to-high-end restaurants within easy walking distance of
  the villa, several of which offer the best dining experiences available in the
  Quepos-Manuel Antonio area. Don't hesitate to ask Rebecca to recommend any of
  them and give information about quality and pricing.
</p>

<h3>Chef</h3>
<p>
  Carlos is our go-to chef for catering and meals prepared on premises. We can
  show you his menu of local and East Asian specialties and put you in direct
  contact with him for any arrangements.
</p>

<h3>Groceries</h3>
<p>
  An eight-minute walk toward the beach brings you to a supermarket named Super
  Josette, which has everything you need: fresh meat, fish, vegetables, fruits,
  and a wide selection of juices, beer, wine, and liquors and an excellent juice
  and wine selection. Fresh-baked bread and pastries are available at a bakery
  only several minutes away. There's a wide range of stores in Quepos to suit
  every need. However, the freshest produce is available Friday evenings and
  Saturdays at the Farmers' Market. For simple items there is a well stocked
  small store near the entrance to the property.
</p>

<h3>Coffee</h3>

<p class="clearfix">
  If you care about you're morning cup as much as we do you should buy your
  roasts at one of
  <a href="https://www.cafemilagro.com" target="_blank">Cafe Milagro's</a>
  two locations. One
  <a href="http://elpatiodecafemilagro.com/" target="_blank">near the house</a>
  on the main road to the beaches just past
  <a href="http://barbarojarestaurante.com" target="_blank">Barba Roja</a>
  (<em>the</em> local bar, killer sunset views and great happy hour) and another
  in Quepos near the main bridge into town.
</p>

<h3>Traveling</h3>
<p>
  We know this area well (we've been coming here since 1980) but for newcomers
  we strongly recommend a good travel book such as Lonely Planet or the New Key
  to Costa Rica (house copies of these are available and should not be removed).
  It is a good idea to look at
  <a target="_blank" href="www.quepolandia.com">Quepolandia</a>
  (click on "visitor resources") before arriving, for current information about
  restaurants, transportation, and local events. The free monthly print version
  is available at many stores.
</p>
<p>
  From San Jose's international airport, Quepos is a twenty-minute flight away,
  or you may enjoy bus ride of a few hours or rent a car, or hire a taxi.
  Rebecca can assist you with local travel arrangements, including current taxi
  rates. All taxis become collectivos, charging a flat price per person when
  they return from the beach toward Quepos. The Quepos-Manuel Antonio bus runs
  every half hour, more often at busy times. The nearest bus stop (5 minutes
  away) is in front of Manuel Antonio's soccer field.
</p>

<h3>Insect tips</h3>
<p>
  Nature is in balance here, and because of the bountiful bird life, insects are
  rarely a problem. Little ankle-nippers may visit at dusk, so use the floor
  fans and the several high-speed ceiling fans. We are rarely bothered by
  mosquitoes, but for those who react to them, we recommend lotions and the use
  of our mosquito nets at night. The larger bugs are totally harmless and some,
  like scarab beetles, are a marvel to watch. The fireflies are a delight.
</p>
<p>
  We tend not to use non-organic insect sprays, though we keep organic ones
  handy: bugs simply don't like white walls and yellow lights, they don't like
  not having hidden spaces to crawl into, and they are bored by people who put
  food away and keep the dishes clean.
</p>
<p>
  A well-trimmed lawn keeps bugs away from the house. The nightjars and the
  flycatchers and the swallows and the blue-grey tanagers and house wrens do the
  rest. Tiny ants, however, will sometimes mysteriously appear, and they do an
  efficient job of cleaning up - if you haven't - but disappear if there's no
  work available.
</p>

<h3>Finally</h3>
<p>
  Please respect our home as you would your own. We do not rent it as a
  profit-making business, but only to ensure that we will not have to lay off
  any of our loyal, longterm staff for the months we aren’t there. We hope you
  have as pleasant a stay as we do when we are there, and at the end of it, if
  you have any comments - useful, critical or otherwise - please let Rebecca
  know. Enjoy the house and the wonders of nature and Tico culture that
  surrounds it.
