<p>
  Villa Tekla is a distinctive three-bedroom, three-level Spanish-Moorish
  hacienda, an eco-friendly villa designed for the tropics, on five acres of
  forest and landscaped grounds, with ocean and mountain views, set off the main
  road. It has extensive patios, is fully furnished and immediately below it is
  a private pool. It can easily accommodate three couples and is perfect for
  families traveling together.
</p>
<p>
  Villa Tekla is completely private - although you might hear an occasional
  vehicle on the road, there are no visible neighbors. It feels as though you
  are in the middle of the jungle - with the convenience of a store at the end
  of the long driveway!
</p>
<p>
  Especially designed for the climate of Costa Rica's south-central coast, Villa
  Tekla is an open house, with screened lower, main and upper level bedrooms. It
  is protected from both sun and rain by wide roof overhangs and is intended to
  provide an optimal experience for nature lovers and yet be entirely secure.
  Sitting atop a volcanic spur over jungle that runs all the way to Manuel
  Antonio National Park, it commands views west, north and east, towards the
  ocean and the forests and the mountains. Rare precious and semi-precious
  flowering hardwoods shade it from the sun.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the acreage is planted in various fruit species, the rest of it is a
  natural canopied forest. The pool has tiled patios immediately adjacent to the
  house.

  Villa Tekla is our family home. We do not rent it as a profit-making business,
  but only to ensure that we will not have to lay off any of our loyal, longterm
  staff for the months we arenâ€™t there.

  The property is midway between the thriving tourist town of Quepos and the
  beaches of
  <a
    href="http://www.sinac.go.cr/EN-US/ac/acopac/pnma/Pages/default.aspx"
    target="_blank"
    >Manuel Antonio National Park</a
  >. The main beach is five minutes away by car or bus, thirty minutes by foot.
  Several smaller, less populated beaches are even closer and we can provide
  directions to them. The park, with its crescent beaches, trails and wildlife,
  offers nature lovers a unique, unforgettable experience. It opens at seven
  a.m. daily, but is closed Monday. It's best to visit early in the morning,
  when the wildlife is most active. Even though staying at Villa Tekla offers
  the opportunity to see as much, if not more, wildlife than a typical day in
  the park, it is still worth visiting for its wonderful walks and beaches.

  Though at nine degrees latitude, the climate is benign, the temperature
  ranging from the lows 20s to low 30s C (low 70s to low 80s F), depending on
  time and season. The dry season extends roughly from Christmas to Easter, but
  is variable, and is cooled by fresh breezes from the ocean during the hottest
  hours. The green season (there is no winter or summer in Costa Rica) is
  preferred by many, with its rain at night, late-afternoon sun-showers, morning
  mists, rainbows and verdant growth - and unpeopled beaches. Occasionally, the
  rain can fall in torrents, and it's an experience which many visitors enjoy.
  Wide roof overhangs and rain blinds keep the villa dry. The house has been
  carefully situated so that the sun does not enter in the heat of the day, and
  it offers brilliant sunset views in the Green Season.

<p>
  As you relax in one of our hammocks, don't be surprised if the titis (squirrel
  monkeys) come by the house, swinging from tree to tree and clambering over the
  roof. Cara blancas (white-face cappuchin monkeys) visit regularly too, and in
  the early morning howler monkeys can be heard calling from the tall trees.
  Other animals we have seen from the house include sloths, coatis, raccoons,
  armadillos, anteaters, pacas, agoutis, land and tree iguanas, a peccary that
  wandered down from the mountains, and a Mexican dwarf porcupine. Birders will
  be awed by the numbers and variety of parrots, parakeets, hummingbirds,
  mot-mots, toucans, manikins, orioles, flycatchers, swallows, tanagers,
  woodpeckers, wrens, thrushes, trogons, hawks, and you'll awake at dawn to a
  many-throated chorus. At night you'll hear nightjars, owls, pootoos, laughing
  falcons, a constant melody of crickets and frogs, and the singing geckoes that
  patrol for small bugs. Birds and butterflies fly in and out.
</p>

<p>
  And from time to time you'll hear the distant crash and rumble of the Pacific
  surf.

  Rates typically run between $170 - $200 (USD) per day depending on the season.
