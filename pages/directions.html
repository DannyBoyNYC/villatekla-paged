<h3>Between San Jose and Quepos</h3>

      Fly
      <a href="https://flysansa.com/manuel-antonio-quepos/" target="_blank"
        >Sansa Air</a
      >
      between the domestic terminal adjacent to the San Jose international
      airport and Quepos. Up to 7 flights a day. Cost: $80-90 USD. Time: 20
      minutes.

    <p>
      Take an express bus between the San Jose and Manuel Antonio bus terminals.
      Approximately 3 hours. Cost: ~$30 USD. For reasons that mystify us, no
      buses pick up at the international airport thus necessitating a trip into
      the city.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take a taxi directly from the San Jose airport. Cost: $120-160 USD
      depending on season, vehicle and your bargaining accumen. Approx. 2.5
      hours. It is a pleasant drive unless you're travelling to the coast at the
      end of the week when traffic can get a bit heavy.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Rent a car at the airport. Note: you do not need a car in Manuel Antonio
      as bus and taxi service are more than adequate. If desired, you can rent a
      car in Manuel Antonio for day trips. There are no rental agencies at the
      airport so be prepared for a short courtesy van ride.

<h3>From Quepos to Villa Tekla</h3>
<p>
  The trip to Villa Tekla starts on the main road to Manuel Antonio National
  Park with one turn at Hotel Villas Lirio.
</p>
<p>
  Once you leave Quepos towards the beaches be on the alert for Villas Lirio on
  your left (about a five minute ride). Villas Lirio is preceded by Hotel Teva
  and then Captains Hotel on the left. In front of Villas Lirio you will find
  the road to Villa Tekla. Continue approx 250 meters up the road until Finca
  los Mangos - 10 meters before the small Super Joseth market and a fork in the
  road. (Do not go past the store!) Villa Tekla is on the left before the fork
  with a black metal gate with a VILLA TEKLA sign. The driveway leads to a white
  three-level house.
</p>
<p>
  The buses from San Jose will let you off across from the Manuel Antonio
  school. The local buses will let you off at the stops near the school's soccer
  field. The house is a 5 minute walk from the school up the Villa Lirio road.
